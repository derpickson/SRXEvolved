Larry's SMART Response XE support library

Features:
--------
1) LCD initialization (4-gray levels) and support to draw 4 sizes of characters and outline+filled rectangles
2) Functions to erase/write/read the external 128K byte SPI FLASH memory
3) Fast GPIO access with simplified pin numbering (e.g. PORTD bit3 = pin 0xD3)
4) Scan the keyboard and return pressed keys translated with the shift/sym keys

Installation:
------------
1) Download the library: https://github.com/bitbank2/SmartResponseXE/archive/master.zip
2) (In the Arduino IDE) Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library > select the downloaded file > Open

Getting Started:
---------------
The first thing to do is initialize and clear the LCD. The pin numbers for the SRXE are:
  // CS, D/C, RESET
  SRXEInit(0xe7, 0xd6, 0xa2); // initialize display
Next, you can draw some text or rectangles. The color can be 0-3 (0=off, 3=fully on)
  SRXEWriteString(0,120,"Hello World!", FONT_LARGE, 3, 0); // draw large black text at x=0,y=120, fg=3, bg=0

Additions:

Brutally lifted from Adafruit GFX library and modified to work with the Smart Response XE by LeRoy Miller, KD8BXP April 2021
Added 
SRXEdrawCircle (int16_t x0, int16_t y0, int16_t r, uint16 color);
Where X0 and Y0 are the Center point of the circle, r is the radius, and color see above
SRXEwriteLine(int16_t x0, int16_t y0, int16_t x1, int16_t y1, uint16_t color);
Where X0, Y0 are the start point cooridinate, X1, Y1 are the end point coordinate, color see above.  
SRXEdrawTriangle(int16_t x0, int16_t y0, int16_t x1, int16_t y1, int16_t x2, int16_t y2, uint16_t color);
Where X0, Y0 is the vertex 0 coordinate, X1, Y1 is the vertex 1 coordinate, X2, Y2 is the vertex 2 coordinate, color see above.
